#Detecting Intentional Accounting Errors
 


This competition requires us to predict misstatements in companies annual financial report filings over the course of 4 years, from 2005-2009.

In addition, a dataset of sentiments was used (8 million~ rows) and readability index were used to increase prediction accuracy.

Our model performed reasonably well, at 72% ROC on the leaderboard.

Special thanks to my groupmates, and Professor Richard Crowley, for this great opportunity.

Data is kept confidential due to its sensitive nature.

Project completed via R, while sentiments acquired using Python.
